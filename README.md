# clock
this is a  clock that needs more customization
I try to make a simple clock using just HTML, CSS and JS. But the problem is the time given by it isn't understood by any body. Not at least by humans. So this needs some repairment and uploading this to github will give me time to think and edit the content without losing the code or have to rewrite the content..
